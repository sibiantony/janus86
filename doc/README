Janus86 - A Bootloader Integrated Kernel 
----------------------------------------

   Janus86 is a new genre of kernel for x86 architecture providing 
functionalities   of a kernel under  the protected / real modes of 
operation and can be deployed to boot a bigger kernel.

Features of this tiny kernel 
----------------------------
1) A new generation  kernel that provides the   functionalities of 
a 32-bit kernel and can switch between protected/real modes .

2) Provides  compatibility with  x86 and  uses a  basic peripheral 
driver set.

3) A  futuristic desgin  in which a  smaller kernel loads a bigger 
Operating system for execution.

4) It provides the functionalities to load and execute x86 
compatible binaries ; kernel images etc. Inspect memory, hardrives
      /harddrive sectors/ filesystem for the presence of operating 
systems  ,  load sectors  into memory ,   perform far jumps, via a
command line interface etc.
