A tiny operating system kernel developed as part of a university project (2005-2006)

Some history
============

In all the academic excitement we built this tiny kernel. At the end, the kernel could load itself into an x86 hardware and it was a bunch of drivers with some primitive memory management built in. It also had the ability to load custom filesystem modules. Multi tasking, our own binary formats etc. were still a distant dream.

The best part is that, it can load another operating system - chainloading, multi boot compliant kernels and early linux kernels. It can also do some memory inspection, ATA drive inspection etc. Handy, if we are stuck with a non-bootable system.
